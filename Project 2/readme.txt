Part 1 folder contains source code for part a.
Sobel.cpp file gives the x-gradient, y-gradient and edge map as output raw files.

Folder Cannystill1 has Cannystill.cpp for canny edge detection. It displays binary edge map as output.

Edges master folder contains all matlab files required for structured edge detection. edgesdemo, edgesEvallmg,
new_edgeeval, new_edgesEvallmg are edited files required for getting desired outputs.
Run edgesDemo to get binary edge maps and F-measure plot by reading Tiger or Pig images.
Run new_edgeeval to get mean precision, mean recall, recall, precision, F-measure in the workspace.

Part 2 folder contains source code for part b.
Run Part21.cpp to get random thresholding output genrated as raw file. 
Run Part22.cpp to get dithering output genrated as raw file.
Run Part23.cpp to get Floyd-Steinberg output genrated as raw file.
Run Part24.cpp to get JJN output genrated as raw file.
Run Part25.cpp to get Stucki output genrated as raw file.
Run separable_error.cpp to get Stucki output genrated as raw file.
Run MBVQ.cpp to get color error diffusion output genrated as raw file.
