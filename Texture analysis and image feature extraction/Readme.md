# Texture analysis and image feature extraction
### Description:
1. In this problem texture classification is performed on 12 texture images using 5x5 Laws filters for feature extraction. PCA is used for dimension reduction and K-means clustering is done  for classifying the images into different types of textures. 
2. Region based texture segmentation is done with Laws filters for extracting features from each image pixel. K-means is then used for clustering similar pixels together and segmenting images into different regions. 
3. SIFT is used for image feature extraction and matching.
4. Image classification with bag of visual words is implemented.

### Requirements:
1) VScode/spyder
