## Edge detection and digital halftoning
Description:
In this project I have implemented classical edge detection methods like Canny, Sobel and Structured edge detector and evaluated their performance. Halftoning methods like Dithering, Random thresholding, Floyd-Steinberg, JJN, and Stucki are implemeted for grayscale images. Separable error diffusion and MBVQ error diffusion halftoning methods for color images have been implemented.

Software Requirements:
1. Any C++ coding platform(JetBrains Clion used for this project)
2. Matlab R2016b is preferable or higher.

Usage:
1. To run Canny edge detection put all images in CannyStill folder and use the following command:

2. To run
