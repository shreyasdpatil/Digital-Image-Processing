For Part1:
1) Run Part11a for lightouse1 ouput of rescaled image of size 160x160.
Run Part12a for lightouse2 ouput of rescaled image of size 160x160.
Run Part13a for lightouse3 ouput of rescaled image of size 160x160.

Run Part1a1a on the outputs obtained from previous parts.

2) Run warping.py to get the final output
3) Run lens_distortion.py to get output for Part1 Q3.

For Part2:
1) Run shrinking.cpp, thinning.cpp and skeletonizing.cpp on different input pattern to get the respective ouptuts.

2) Run defect_detection.cpp to get the coordinates of the defects and the final defectless output.

3) Run object_analysis.m to get ouptuts of different morphological operations, areas of grains and average 
area of each type of grain.
